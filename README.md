K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification - ReadMe

Objective

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for solving a classification problem using Python and popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


---

Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Pandas

Matplotlib

Numpy



---

Dataset

The Iris Dataset is used in this project.

The dataset contains features of iris flowers and their corresponding species.

Only the first two features are used for easy 2D visualization of decision boundaries.



---

Project Steps

1. Load Dataset:

The Iris dataset is loaded from sklearn.datasets.



2. Feature Normalization:

Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to distance calculations.



3. Data Splitting:

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.



4. KNN Model Implementation:

KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn is used.

You can experiment with different values of K (number of neighbors).



5. Model Evaluation:

Model is evaluated using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix.

Confusion Matrix is visualized for clarity.



6. Decision Boundary Visualization:

The decision boundaries for different classes are plotted for better understanding of the model's performance.

How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file).


2. Run the cells one by one.


3. Experiment with different values of k in the KNN classifier.


4. Observe the decision boundaries and confusion matrix.

Output Examples

Printed Accuracy Score.

Confusion Matrix with class labels.

2D plot showing decision boundaries for the Iris dataset.

Future Improvements

Try with all 4 features for better accuracy (but skip decision boundary visualization).

Apply KNN on different datasets like Breast Cancer or Titanic dataset.

Tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
